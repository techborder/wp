=========

WordPress - Themes and child themes mostly.

This repo will include all of the themes that I [DR] might use at various WP sites I maintain. This will allow me an easy way to update themes, plugins and even WP (if no DB changes are needed).

For WP upgrades, after updating the code via git, WP might need database schema upgrade. I need to experiment with this.
