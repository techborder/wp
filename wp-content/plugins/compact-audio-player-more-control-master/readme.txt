* Add the audio player to any post/page using shortcode
* Use autoplay option to play an audio/mp3 file as soon as the page loads

= How to add to your theme =

See http://www.techborder.com/wordpress-plugin-compact-audio-player-more-control.

== Download ==

On github: https://github.com/techborder/compact-audio-player-more-control.git.

== Configuration ==

Once the code has been added to your theme, set your File URL (audio file) in Dashboard > Settings > C Audio Player MC.

In the settings, in Audio File, add full URL to the song or audio.

== Settings controlled in Dashboard ==

Audio file (File URL).
Loop.
Auto-play.
If given as attributes in the shortcode capmc_embed_player_settings, they will be ignored and overridden by the settings in the Dashboard.

== Pass-through attributes ==

Just as in Compact Audio Player, you can still control attributes of volume and CSS class through the shortcode capmc_embed_player_settings.

<?php
    echo do_shortcode('[capmc_embed_player_settings volume="90"]');
?>

== Pass-through shortcode attributes ==

 1. volume.
 2. class.

== License ==

GPLv3

== Details ==

Even though the icon shows a mute button, the action that takes place is not muting the volume but stopping the audio file from playing. A couple reasons for this:

  * Most visitors that do not want any sound so their first instinct is to go for the mute button.
  * Many times there is already a photo gallery slider control that uses the play and pause symbol. Adding another play and pause icon would confuse the visitor.

== Support ==

Code is free under GPLv3. Support is provided for a fee as a consulting service - Contact to hire us.
